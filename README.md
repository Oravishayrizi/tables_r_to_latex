This repository contains R scripts designed to generate tables formatted for LaTeX documents, along with instructions for embedding these tables into LaTeX. 
This is how I currently work to automating and standardizing regression tables for academic papers or reports.

# Project Structure

The project includes two main R scripts and accompanying LaTeX files:

    R Scripts:
        tables_commands.R: Defines functions for manipulating and preparing tables for LaTeX export.
        minimal_example.R: Demonstrates how to use the functions in tables_commands.R to generate tables and export them to LaTeX format.

    LaTeX Files:
        tableA.tex, tableB.tex, table_panels.tex: Examples of tables generated by the R scripts, ready to be embedded in LaTeX documents.
        tables.tex: A LaTeX document that includes embedded tables as examples.
